In logistics, the center of gravity analysis is used to derive the ideal location for warehousing or last mile or first mile facilities 
by calculating the transport costs/distance to each of the supply or demand locations to be served by the facility.

The center of gravity is therefore the location giving the lowest total transport costs or distance.
